## Introduction

Flixify is a simple web application that I decided to built in order to practice and demonstrate proficiency with modern JavaScript techniques, especially the use of APIs, Promises, and the Fetch API. It leverages the power of The Movie Database API to fetch, display, and manipulate movie data.

## Features

- **Swiper API Integration**: The main page includes a slider that uses the Swiper API for a dynamic and responsive display.
- **FontAwesome Library**: The app integrates the FontAwesome library for the use of icons to enhance the UI.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for their favorite movies and TV shows using the search page.
- **Trending Content**: The website showcases trending movies and TV shows fetched from the TMDB API.

🚧 This section will be updated as more features are added 🚧
